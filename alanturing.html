      <h2 style="font-size:60px;"> Alan Turing</h2>
      <p style= "text-align:left;" 
     <p> The Enigma Machine was an advanced cipher or coding machine, developed in Germany after World War I. The Germans mistakenly believed the Allies would not be able to break the codes.</p>
  
      <p>The machine was used to send top secret messages. It used a system of replacing one letter with another, and sent the messages using a standard Morse code transmitter.</p>
      
      <p>A team of code breakers, mathematicians and electronics experts was set up to break the codes. Some of the team was skilled at chess, crossword puzzles and ancient writing.</p>
      
      The team was known as the Government Code and Cipher School. It was based in several huts in the grounds of Bletchley Park, a mansion near Milton Keynes.
      One of the most well-known codebreakers was Alan Turing. Turing devised several techniques to break German codes and was awarded the OBE by King George VI in 1945.
      The knowledge learned from breaking the Enigma Machine codes was known as ‘ultra’. It helped the Allies to prepare for the D-Day invasion and to shorten World War II by several years.
      
      The Allies found it very difficult to decipher the codes, often going for months without doing so. The German Navy’s enigma messages were not deciphered for 4 years, from 1937 to 1941.
      
      About 100,000 Enigma Machines were made. After World War II, the British and American governments sold some of the captured Enigma Machines.
      Today, Bletchley Park is a museum, and has several Enigma Machines, as well as other computing exhibits.
      
      Enigma machines were used in the field by troops or spies where as the German high command had a more powerful encryption than the troops called the Lorenz. Both machines could be deciphered by the end of the war

      Alan Turing 
      1912	Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, 
      • 1934	Alan graduates with distinction in Mathematics from King's College, Cambridge.
      • 1938	Alan goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is awarded a PhD.
      • 1939	September - Alan is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School • 1940	With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe to decipher the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine.
      • 1945	At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services.
      • 1946	Alan publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer.
      • 1949	Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University.
      • 1950	Alan publishes the famous paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test.
      • 1952	Alan is arrested. He loses his security clearance so he cannot work. He is offered chemical treatment instead of going to prison. The treatment makes him very unwell.
      • 1954	Alan dies in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire, from poisoning. A half-eaten apple was found next to him laced with cyanide.
      • 2009	Thousands of people sign a petition. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown makes a public apology saying the treatment of Alan Turing was "appalling".
